  "prompt": "I need a new ERP that use AI",
  "response": "If you’re looking for a new ERP system with AI capabilities, there are a strong set of options and considerations. To make the best choice, let’s break this into three parts:\n\n✅ What “AI-enabled ERP” means\nModern ERP systems are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple ways. Some capabilities to look for:\n- Predictive analytics (forecasting demand, cash flow, supply-chain risk) and anomaly detection.\n- Natural-language interfaces / chatbots (so you can ask the system questions in regular language).\n- Workflow automation / AI agents that trigger tasks (rather than just human steps).\n- Integration across modules (finance, procurement, inventory, HR) with a unified data view so AI can analyze across silos.\n\nKnowing those features, you can evaluate options based on how deeply AI is embedded (versus just “AI add-on”).\n\n🔍 Good vendor / product options\nHere are a few specific ERP systems with strong AI capabilities you should consider:\n- aiERP by Priority: This vendor describes a fully AI-first platform: natural language queries, embedded AI throughout modules (supply chain, demand forecasting, etc).\n- Epicor Prism: Built into the legacy ERP vendor’s stack, focused on manufacturing/operations (“makers, movers & sellers”), with vertical AI agents and insight extraction.\n- ERP·AI: An interesting “AI-native” platform: no code, AI agents, unified enterprise knowledge graph, and can be on-premises or private cloud.\n- SAP S/4HANA Cloud (with “Joule” AI): According to research listings, SAP’s ERP includes generative AI, predictive ML, agent/copa features across modules.\n\n📋 How to pick the right one for your organization\nWhen selecting, tailor to your business size, industry, data maturity and future-growth plans. Here are questions to ask & criteria:\n- What modules do you need now (finance, inventory, supply chain, HR, manufacturing)? Does the system support them well?\n- How much data integration is required (across your systems, departments)? AI only works if data is accurate & unified.\n- What AI features are built-in vs “add-ons” you pay separately?\n- Deployment: cloud vs on-premises vs hybrid (you might have data/residency constraints).\n- Scalability & industry-specific needs: e.g., manufacturing vs services vs retail.\n- Implementation time/cost: newer “AI-native” systems may promise faster setup but check maturity & ecosystem.\n- Vendor ecosystem: support, updates, AI roadmap, integrations with your existing tools.\n- Data governance, security & transparency: Since AI will touch sensitive data, you’ll want clear controls and auditing.\n\nCriteria to evaluate:\n- **AI depth**: Does the AI just provide analytics or does it automate workflows?\n- **Usability**: Can non-technical users use the AI features (natural language, simple UI)?\n- **Data readiness**: Do you have clean data integrated systems definitions aligned?\n- **Return on investment (ROI)**: Where will the AI help most? E.g., reducing manual reconciliation better forecasting fewer stockouts.\n- **Risk/adoption**: AI introduces new risks (mistakes hallucinatory insights) — are expectations realistic?",
